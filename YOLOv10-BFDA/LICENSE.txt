                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation
with the community in the case of network server software.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take
away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, our General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of
a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General
Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute
copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code
or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you
legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

  A secondary benefit of defending all users’ freedom is that improvements made in
alternate versions of the program, if they become common, will be shared back to the
community, and by using the GNU Affero General Public License, you can ensure that
this never happens.

  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed to prevent someone from taking
the source code of a program that uses this License, modifying it, and then hiding it
from the community by using it on a server.  Therefore, if you run a modified program on
a server and let other people communicate with it there, your modified version must
also be made available to them under the terms of this License.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

  “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
  “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,
for example, semiconductor masks.
  “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
  “You” means the individual or entity that interacts with or is otherwise
affected by the Program.  “License” shall mean this document.
  “Modification” means any work containing or derived from the Program or any portion
of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
  “Covered Work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.
  “Appropriate Legal Notices” means notices that must be preserved in any copy of the
work.
  An “entity” is a corporation, company, organization, or other institution.
  “Source Code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications
to it.
  “Object Code” means any non-Source Code form of a work.

  A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard or, in
the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
widely used among developers working in that language.

  “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a
whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which
is not part of that Major Component, and (b) is intended to be used only in conjunction
with the Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation
is available to the public in source code form.  A “Major Component”, in this context,
means a major essential component (kernel, window system, etc.) of the specific operating
system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work,
or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code
needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to
modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not
include the work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part
of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated
with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate
data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically,
for example, via a tool that is provided as part of the Major Component, or provided for
that purpose on a publicly available server, and so on, provided that the users have
control over the generation of that material.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of GPL v3.

  You may convey a work based on this License, under terms of your choice, provided that
you also meet, for each version of the work that you convey, the terms and conditions of
this License.  However, if the modified work has additional requirements that do not
satisfy the conditions of this License, then you may not distribute it.

2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the
Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.  This License
explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output
from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content,
constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other
equivalents as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions
so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others
for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License
in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making or running
the covered work for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control,
on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their
relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated
below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any
applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any
medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option
offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program,
in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:
  
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a
    relevant date.
  
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License
    and any conditions added under section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section
    4 to “keep intact all notices”.
  
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into
    possession of a copy.  This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are
    packaged.  This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
  
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices;
    however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices,
    your work need not make them do so.
  
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their
  nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
  in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its
  resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the
  individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to
  the other parts of the aggregate.
  
6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that
you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:
  
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied
    by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
  
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied
    by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support
    for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all
    the software in the product that is covered by this License, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a
    network server at no charge.
  
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.
  
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offering equivalent
    access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge.
  
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and
    Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection (d).
  
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System
  Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.
  
7. Additional Terms.

  “Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or
more of its conditions.  Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though
they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program
remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.
  
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy,
or from any part of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify
the work.)  You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have
or can give appropriate copyright permission.
  
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the
  copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
  
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
  
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate
    Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or
  
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be
    marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
  
    d) Limiting the use of the material in certain fields, and stating that such use is restricted to those fields; or
  
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
  
    f) Requiring indemnification of further release.
  
  For example, a later version of the Program may include a “User Product” exception as defined in section 4 of the
  GNU General Public License for the Program, which is intended to permit commercial use of a modified version
  of the Program in a consumer product.
  
  If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License
  along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further
  restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by
  the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing.

8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
to propagate or modify it otherwise is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, your license from a particular version of the covered work is
  reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holders express explicitly that your license has been
  terminated, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holders do not notify you of the violation in time after a provisional
  reinstatement.

  Moreover, your license is reinstated permanently if you correct the violation within a reasonable period after
  receiving notice of the violation.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary
  propagation of a covered work occurring entirely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
  to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you
  permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept
  this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License
  to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors,
  to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing
  compliance by third parties with this License.

  An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of
  one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.  If such an entity transaction occurs, each
  party to that transaction that receives a copy of the covered work also receives whatever licenses to the
  covered work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, except
  that the source code for a work that is received in an object code distribution need not be transmitted
  along with it.

11. Patents.

  A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which
  the Program is based.  The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.
  In this section, “patent license” means any express, implied, or statutory license to any patent(s) that would
  be infringed by making, using, or selling the contributor version, but for which the contributor has not
  received written assurance that they will not be infringed.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s
  essential patents to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise run, modify and propagate the
  contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a “patent claim” is any patent claim, now in force or hereafter amended,
  which would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor
  version, but solely for a particular product or service of a particular company or organization unless that
  license, or exemption therefrom, is extended to all third parties.

  Notwithstanding anything else in this License, no contributor shall be obligated to grant any patent license
  with respect to any work that users (or other third parties) combine with the contributor’s version, if, at
  the time the contributor last contributed to the work, the contributor had knowledge that, but for the patent
  license, it would have been infringing such patent claims.

  If, as a consequence of a patent lawsuit or claim, a contributor determines that the covered work is
  being used in a manner that would infringe one or more valid patent claims, then such contributor may
  terminate this License for any party that engages in such infringement.

12. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS”
  WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
  WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  The entire risk as to the quality
  and performance of the program is with you.  Should the program prove defective, you assume the cost
  of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

13. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,
  OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
  DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
  OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
  INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
  OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

14. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local
  legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely
  approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a
  warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

HOW TO APPLY THIS LICENSE TO YOUR PROGRAM

  To apply this license, attach the following notices to your program.  It is safest to attach them
to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
  
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
